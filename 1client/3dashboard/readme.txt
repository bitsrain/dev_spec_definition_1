dashboard's job blocks work this way:
- no jobs posted yet, the button leads to new job post flow
- job posted, no proposals, the buttons leads to job_details/invite_freelancers tab
- job posted, some proposals, the button leads to job_details/proposals tab

message and hire talent block's button leads to messages page

search talent button doesn't open a modal, it leads to talent search page

all 4 blocks on the bottom of the dashboard leads to corresponding Upwork help articles, it's outside of Upwork
