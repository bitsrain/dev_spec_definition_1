verify:
	- phone number: automatically checked when you do phone verification (SMS)
        - ID: automatically checked when you finish verification (verification process cannot be collected, 'cause it's done by foreign guys, not by us)
	- veteran: provided screenshot, not sure how this works, cannot test.

license:
	- I have no valid license, cannot test further
video introduction:
	- Youtube banned here, and it'd put account on a big risk. Can't proceed further. Provided other guys' profile status when added the video introduction instead. Again, Youtube banned, cannot provide the screenshot when clicked on the video thumbnail.
